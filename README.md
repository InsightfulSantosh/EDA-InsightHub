## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data science project. It helps in uncovering underlying patterns, identifying anomalies, testing hypotheses, and checking assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. This repository is designed to guide you through the EDA process, ensuring you can make data-driven decisions with confidence.

## Components of EDA

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. This section covers:

- **Measures of Location**: Mean, Median, Mode, Percentiles, Quartiles
- **Measures of Spread**: Variance, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Interquartile Range (IQR), Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)
- **Measures of Symmetry**: Skewness
- **Measures of Shape**: Kurtosis

### Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics allow you to make inferences about a population based on a sample. This section includes:

- **Strength of Association**: Pearson's Correlation, Spearman's Rank Correlation, Cramer's V
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Tests for normality (Shapiro-Wilk, Anderson-Darling), association tests (Chi-Square, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis)
- **Hypothesis Testing Steps**: 
  1. State the hypotheses
  2. Determine significance level
  3. Perform the test
  4. Collect and analyze data
  5. Compute test statistics
  6. Make conclusions

### Data Visualization

Visualization is key in EDA for understanding the data. This section covers:

- **Univariate Plots**: Histograms, KDE Plots, Box Plots, Violin Plots, Count Plots
- **Bivariate Plots**: Scatter Plots, Hexbin Plots, Bar Plots
- **Multivariate Plots**: Pair Plots, Correlation Heatmaps, Facet Grids

## Step-by-Step EDA Process

A guided process to perform EDA:

1. **Import Libraries**: Load the necessary Python libraries.
2. **Check and Fix Data Types**: Ensure all variables have the correct data types.
3. **Read Data**: Load the dataset for analysis.
4. **High-Level Summary**: Use `.info()` and `.describe()` methods for a quick overview.
5. **Analyze Missing Values**: Visualize missing data and decide on a handling strategy.
6. **Analyze Outliers**: Detect outliers using methods like Isolation Forest.
7. **Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between variables using correlation matrices.
8. **Detailed Feature Analysis**: Explore each feature with summary statistics and plots.
9. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve the model's performance.
10. **Iterative Analysis**: Refine your analysis iteratively, documenting insights.

## Automated EDA Tools

Automated tools to expedite the EDA process:

- **Pandas Profiling (ydata-profiling)**
- **Sweetviz**
- **Autoviz**
- **D-Tale**

These tools provide quick insights and visualization, reducing the manual effort required for EDA.
